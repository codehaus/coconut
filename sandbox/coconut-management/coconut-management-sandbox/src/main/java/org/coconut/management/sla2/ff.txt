Example:

Latency -> Never above 10 
			create a filter, and check it
			
		//Slas.lessThen
        -> Never above 10 in 5 seconds (keep timestamp for above)
           create a field, and some that checks the number of violations
           
           //Slas.outOf
           
        -> Never above 10 in more then 5 seconds within a 60 second period
        -> Never rise more then 2 in 5 seconds (keep a window)

        -> Between 5 and 10
        
        -> Not out of the range for more the 5 seconds
        
        //between + outOf
