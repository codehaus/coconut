This package contains the cache loading service. Cache loading refers to
the process whereby a cache transparently (lazy) loads or creates a
value for a requesting key specified by the user. This technique can
often be more efficient then requiring a user to fill up the cache in
advance. A cache loader might load data from an external site, a
databases or just a plain text-based file. Data can also be created on
the fly, for example, as a result of some calculation.
