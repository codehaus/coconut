	PocketCache
</body>
PocketCache is a small embedable in-memory cache with no dependencies except JDK 1.5.

This contains a small number of in-memory cache implementations.
There are 3 different types categorized according to their concurrent abilities.

Goal of PocketCache
Mission
Less the 100 kb
No Dependencies
Less then 20 classes
Well documented
Well tested (95 % coverage)
Supporting
A small Cache library, less then 100 kb, no depencies, less then 20 classes
Well documented in javadoc
Well tested
Supports

Functionality
eviction/size-limit - hit stats, value loader

Ending with Map is very similar to ordinary maps except that they support lazy-loading of values using a ValueLoader
* ConcurrentMap -> no eviction, but value loader
* Cache -> eviction/size limit - hit stats

UnsafePocketCache -> not threadsafe cache
SynchronousPocketCache -> synchronous cache

It will not (and not ever) support the following functionality
  Storing of cache data (except serialization)
  Notification of cache events
  Expiration of items (specifying a timeout for values)
  Transactions
  Distributed version
Look at its big brother Coconut Cache if you need any of this functionality
